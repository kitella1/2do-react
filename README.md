# 2Do - The Task Management App ✅

Welcome to 2Do! My submission for the Senior Software Engineer role with the NHS.

## Features 🔨

2Do has a range of features available.

- Add new tasks using the input fields.
- Complete and delete tasks individually.
- Complete and delete multiple items on your list with 'Edit mode'.
- Lists are saved to local storage whenever an item is added, deleted, or updated.

## Design 🎨

2Do uses the colour scheme [Dark Sunset](https://coolors.co/palette/335c67-fff3b0-e09f3e-9e2a2b-540b0e).

The teal colour #335C67 should be used as the **primary** colour for UI elements. The light yellow #FFF3B0 should be used as an **accent** where it will not impede on accessibility. Lastly, for any other UI that is required to **contrast** the primary colour, the crimson #9E2A2B should be used.
